# We want to look at, in the final shiny app, how often items from the Modern
# and Contemporary Art galleries (rooms numbered 1120, 1110, 1100) get moved and
# if there is a correlation with the artist's ethnic background or nationality,
# which, in this dataset, can be defined as the variable, "personculture".

# we can also look at the number of times an object has been viewed online,
# given to us by the dataset that was pulled from the api. Add a total pageviews
# variable while keeping the yearly pageviews observations intact with mutate.
  
# To see how often an object has moved, we need to add combine the types of
# moves to form a total moves variable, while keeping the types of moves. to do
# this, use mutate.

# I am ignoring 2008 values because they are 1) all NA values and I don't have
# the data to replace the NAs with numbers, which 2) makes them a logical
# vector. I use as.numeric() to change this below, but it didn't replace NA's
