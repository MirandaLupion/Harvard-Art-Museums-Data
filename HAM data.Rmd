## We want to look at, in the final shiny app, how often objects from the Modern
#and Contemporary Art galleries (rooms numbered 1120, 1110, 1100) get moved and
#if there is a correlation with the artist's ethnic background or nationality,
#which, in this dataset, can be defined as the variable, "personculture".

# The number of times an object has been moved in a given year is defined as
# "moves_year".

# The number of times an object has been viewed online each year, given to us by
# the dataset that was pulled from the api, is defined as "pageviews_year".

# Note: I am ignoring 2008 values because they are 1) all NA values and I don't have
# the data to replace the NAs with numbers, which 2) makes them a logical
# vector. I use as.numeric() to change this below, but it didn't replace NA's
# with numerical values.

# study center views indicate the number of times an object was requested to be
# viewed in the 4th floor study center at the Fogg museum, so we can count this
# as an instance when an object was viewed in person.


# start tidying the data. Translate all new NA's into 0's.
